# ECLI text filter
This is a moodle plugin which filters text for ECLI case identifiers, and automatically
links them. Currently it will only take Dutch ECLI identifiers, (prefixed ECLI:NL:) and
links them to the text on http://rechtspraak.nl.

## Settings
There's both a global and local setting to open links in a new tab (the non-standard
target="_blank" is used). Use them if you must, but really, leave that decision to the
end-user.

## Bugs and feature requests: Please use github issues.
